# centipedes
Exploration of centipedal locomotion via 2D simulation in Processing.
Simulation folders require box2d for processing fo physics simulation, but otherwise implement all required classes. 

Work performed during coursework of CMPE216, Bio-Inspired Locomotion (and pushed to github 2 years later)
